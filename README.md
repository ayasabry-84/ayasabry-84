### 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm currently a learner in the **ALX Software Engineering** and **ProDev AI** programs, diving deep into software design, AI, and real-world applications.

I started this journey because I believe in **technology that makes a difference**—solutions that **empower underserved communities**, **enhance access to education & healthcare**, **automate tedious workflows**, and **make everyday tools smarter with AI**.

> “I’m stepping into four months of deep focus, challenge, and growth.  
> I see a future version of myself—confident, capable, and ready to build and lead.  
> This is not just the beginning of a program. It’s the beginning of everything I’ve been working toward.”
