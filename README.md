### 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm currently a learner in the **ALX Software Engineering** and **ProDev AI** programs, diving deep into software design, AI, and real-world applications.

I started this journey because I believe in **technology that makes a difference**—solutions that **empower underserved communities**, **enhance access to education & healthcare**, **automate tedious workflows**, and **make everyday tools smarter with AI**.
